Usage: AUTO: iam_role_clone_non_enumerable_name </br>
Limitations: The bot doesn't delete the original role, in order to avoid misconfigurations. After the role will be cloned, it's under your responsibility to delete the original role, after
validating it (For example, it's important to make sure that you do not have any Amazon EC2 instances running with the role). If you're using the bot via CSPM, the rule will keep failing
until the original role (with the enumerable name) will be deleted. In the response message of the bot, you'll get the information about the old and the new (cloned) role. </br>

<current epoch time>  
Usage:  mark\_for\_stop\_ec2\_resource <time>\<unit(m,h,d)\>  
Example:  mark\_for\_stop\_ec2\_resource 3h  
Note: This is meant to be used in conjunction with a more aggressive
action like stopping or termanating an instance. The first step will be
to tag an instance with the time that we want to trigger the remediation
bot.  
From there, a rule like "Instance should not have tags with \[
key='marked\_for\_stop' and value before(1, 'minutes') \]" can be ran to
check how long an instance has had the 'mark for stop' tag. Limitations:
none

 ## s3\_enable\_logging

What it does: Turns on server access logging. The target bucket needs to
be in the same region as the remediation bucket or it'll throw a
CrossLocationLoggingProhibitted error. This bot will create a bucket to
log to as well. Usage:  s3\_enable\_logging  
Limitations: none

## s3\_enable\_versioning

Limitations: The bot removes the policies for *all* the mentioned actions, if exist.

## s3\_only\_allow\_ssl
What it does: Ensure that S3 Buckets enforce encryption of data transfers using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
Usage:  s3_only_allow_ssl
Note: The bot looks at the bucket policy and adds to the current policy the missing actions(s3:GetObject and s3:PutObject)
      and the SSL statement.
      if no policy in the bucket, an SSL policy will add to the bucket
Limitations: none

## secretsmanager_enable_encryption
What it does: Enables data-at-rest encryption using KMS CMK (Customer Master Key). <br>
Usage: AUTO secretsmanager_enable_encryption <kms-key-id> <br>
EXAMPLE: secretsmanager_enable_encryption aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeee <br>
Notes: <br>
secretsmanagers can be encrypted by a symmetric key only. <br> 
As a security best practice, we recommend to encrypt it with CMK. The bot will throw an error for aws-managed keys. <br>
The provided key must be in the same region as the secret. <br>
Required permissions: "secretsmanager:UpdateSecret", "kms:GenerateDataKey", "kms:Decrypt".

## sg_clear_rules_for_any_scope

SG.

##sg\_modify\_scope\_by\_port

What it does: modify Security Group's rules scope by a given port , new and old scope(optional).
Direction can be : inbound or outbound

Usage: sg_modify_scope_by_port <port> <change_scope_from|*> <change_scope_to> <direction>
 - When '*' set for replacing any rule with the specific port

Examples:
        
        sg_modify_scope_by_port 22 0.0.0.0/0 10.0.0.0/24 inbound
        sg_modify_scope_by_port 22 * 10.0.0.0/24 inbound
Notes:

    -  if the port is in a rule's port range, the bot will change the rule's ip to desire ip , to avoid that
      specify existing rule's scope instead of using '*'
    - to split the rule around the port you can use the bot : #sg_single_rule_delete

Limitations: IPv6 is not supported yet

Usage:  sg\_rules\_delete  
Limitations: none


## sg_delete_not_matching_cidr
What it does: Deletes all rules on a security group , that have the given port and have a scope outside the given cidr
        * following GSL - SecurityGroup should not have inboundRules contain [ port<=x and portTo>=x and scope!= y  ]

Usage: sg_delete_not_matching_cidr <port> <cidr> <direction>

Parameters:
    port: number
    scope: a.b.c.d/e
    direction: inbound/ outbound


Example:

    sg_delete_not_matching_cidr 22 10.163.0.0/16 inbound

    *all the sg's rules with port 22 that have scope with range outside of 10.163.0.0/16 scope ,  will be deleted

Notes :

    -  before running this bot, ensure that your applications will work correctly without those rules
    - if a port is in a port range and there is a mismatch in cidr the rule will be deleted ( with all the other port in range )

Limitations: IPv6 is not supported yet



## sg_rules_delete_by_scope
What it does: Deletes all rules on a security group with a scope(cidr) containing or equal to a given scope,
             port and protocol are optional

Usage: sg_rules_delete_by_scope <scope> <direction> <port|*> <protocol|*>

Parameters:
   
    scope: a.b.c.d/e
    direction: inbound/ outbound
    port: number/ *
    protocol: TCP/ UDP/ *
    -When '*' is any value of the parameter

Examples:
    
    sg_rules_delete_by_scope 0.0.0.0/0 inbound 22 tcp

    all rules with 1.0.0.0/16 scope will be deleted for any port and protocol:
    sg_rules_delete_by_scope 1.0.0.0/16 inbound * *

    all rules with 0.0.0.0/0 scope will be deleted for port 22 and any protocol:
    sg_rules_delete_by_scope 0.0.0.0/0 inbound 22 *

Notes :
    
    - the bot deletes the rule without splitting ports ( do not create new rules without the deleted port)
      for deleting rule with split use - sg_single_rule_delete bot .
    -  before running this bot, ensure that your applications will work correctly without those rules
    - if a port is in a port range the rule wont be deleted ! use * on port parameter to delete the rule for any port
Limitations: IPv6 is not supported

## sg\_single\_rule\_delete

What it does: Deletes a single rule on a security group Usage: 
sg\_single\_rule\_delete split=\<true|false\> protocol=\<TCP|UDP\>
scope=\<a.b.c.d/e\> direction=\<inbound|outbound\> port=<number>

Example:  sg\_single\_rule\_delete split=false protocol=TCP
scope=0.0.0.0/0 direction=inbound port=22 Sample GSL: SecurityGroup
should not have inboundRules with \[scope = '0.0.0.0/0' and port\<=22
and portTo\>=22\]

Conditions and caveats: Deleting a single rule on a security group can
be difficult because the problematic port can be nested within a wider
range of ports. If SSH is open because a SG has all of TCP open, do you
want to delete the whole rule or would you break up the SG into the same
scope but port 0-21 and a second rule for 23-end of TCP port range?
Currently the way this is being addressed is using the 'split'
parameter. If it's set as false, CloudBots will only look for the
specific port in question. If it's nested within a larger port scope,
it'll be skipped. If you set split to true, then the whole rule that the
problematic port is nested in will be removed and 2 split rules will be
added in its place (ex: if port 1-30 is open and you want to remove SSH,
the new rules will be for port 1-21 and port 23-30).

If you want to delete a rule that is open on ALL ports:
Put Port 0 as the port to be deleted and the bot will remove the rule.
If you want to delete a rule that is open to ALL :
Put protocol=ALL and the bot will remove the open rule that configured with ALL as protocol
If you want to delete a rule that is open no matter to the configured protocol 
Put protocol=* and the bot will remove the open rule  
Set Split to True
 sg_single_rule_delete split=true protocol=TCP scope=8.8.8.8/32 direction=inbound port=0   

Limitations: IPv6 is not supported

## sns_enforce_sse
What it does: makes sns topic use server side encryption (sse) </br>
Usage:  sns_enforce_sse kmsKeyId=aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeee </br>
Limitations: none


## sqs_enforce_sse
What it does: Configures server-side encryption (SSE) for a queue <br>
Usage: sqs_enforce_sse &lt;kmsKeyId> &lt;kmsRegion> <br>
Notes: <br>
For encryption with SQS-owned encryption keys, use the bot without any parameters (i.e: sqs_enforce_sse) <br>
For encryption using kms, provide &lt;kmsKeyId>. &lt;kmsRegion> is not required - provide it if the kms key is in a different region than the SQS. <br>
Examples: <br>
sqs_enforce_sse (for encryption using SQS-owned encryption keys) <br>
sqs_enforce_sse kms aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeee <br>
sqs_enforce_sse kms aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeee us-east-2 <br>
sqs_enforce_sse kms mrk-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa (for multi-region key) <br>
sqs_enforce_sse kms mrk-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa (for multi-region key, if it's in a different region) <br>
Limitations: The KMS key MUST be in the same AWS account as the SQS. 

## sqs_configure_dlq
What it does: Configures a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) for a source queue. <br>

# Optional Bots

These bots are not packaged with the core Lambda function because
they're extremely impactful or edge-case bots that won't be normally
used.  
If you want to use these bots, they will need to be manually added to
the function. All of the code is in the optional\_bots directory.
